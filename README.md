## Motovations
- Using django with django rest because it is very quick to make a simple api and django/python is familair.
- Using svelte because new and fun, seems quite quick to develop.
- Using axios because used in past, could use fetch but speed.
- Retro styling because simple is good ;)
- Deleting tasks is broken, ran out of time to fix.
